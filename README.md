### About me

**Hi there!** I'm a passionate computer science student at Cal State Fullerton, currently in my second year. I'm also a lucky Google STEP intern - I had the amazing opportunity to intern with them in 2023, and I'm thrilled to be returning for another round in 2024!

In my free time, I love to tinker with new technologies, go to the gym, and explore the outdoors. I'm always looking to connect with other passionate people in the tech community, so feel free to reach out! You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-chan12/).
